            <p><b>Dr. Maruf Ahmed</b> - "I am happy to welcome you to our lab. Generally, people prepare, process, or consume food in a variety of ways, whether it comes from plants, animals, fungi, or other sources. Currently, food shortages are significant issues globally. Innovation and problem-solving in the food sector are essential for ensuring that food products are safe, of high quality, and flexible to customer and environmental needs. Consequently, this lab plays a vital role in the food sector, developing eco-friendly food processing methods, extending shelf life, augmenting nutritional content, waste management, and satisfying customer requirements. Besides this, the lab also focuses on food microbiology and manufacturing the equipment that is used in the food industry. This lab will serve as a bridge between the scientific understanding of food and its practical application, ensuring that the global food supply is safe, high-quality, and capable of meeting the demands of a growing population.
