The research evaluates the probiotic potential of these isolates based on key criteria such as acid and bile tolerance, antimicrobial activity, adhesion to intestinal cells, and production of bioactive compounds. Identifying robust probiotic strains from fermented vegetables can pave the way for their application in functional foods and dietary supplements, promoting gut health and overall well-being.","Ongoing","Not Available","N\A","2007062","https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1dEOxl8aCaVo0t_VklPhFHid6_egSMNSp"
